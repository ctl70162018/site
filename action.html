          <p> In my own practice, I look for ways to incorporate technology beyond its regular use as projection device, minds on video, or interactive quiz. Throughout this course on integrating technology into the classroom, I have learned to critically analyze technology from a pedagogical perspective, in order to see how it is aiding in my ability to deliver course content and allowing students to engage and demonstrate curriculum expectations. 


With this in mind, I am particularly proud of my ability throughout this course to use a hyperlink-based narrative-building platform called Twine to construct a story (add link). As a humanities teacher many of our courses are designed to be incredibly low-tech, and using this platform to teach the English curriculum feels like a step in technology’s direction.

            With Twine, a student learns the elements of coding websites to construct their story, and hosts it onto the web to be viewed by an authentic audience. In this case, technology is not only something that students are gaining implicit knowledge of through their demonstration of the English curriculum, it is also being used to increase their creativity, allowing them to problem solve and think critically, and share something they are proud of to a global audience – all important elements of the 21st century competencies we in Ontario are trying to implement (Ontario Ministry of Education 2016).

Throughout this course, I have been taught about tech integration frameworks such as the SAMR model of Dr. Ruben Puentedura and TPACK of Mishra and Kohler (2006). In terms of the SAMR model, – which illustrates how technologies can have varying levels of meaningful uses in a classroom from simply acting as a substitution for a low-tech alternative up to using technology to redefine and create new tasks in the classroom that could not be done before, – Twine allows for students to make stories with a degree of control and expression that could not be done without the use of its coding language  (Puentedura 2014). Thinking of this use of technology on the TPACK model, which considers the ways three variables within a classroom – content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and technological knowledge – interact with each other to inform best practices in teaching, Twine effectively leverages technology with relevant content in an English classroom and an engaging inquiry-based pedagogical approach to make its TPACK combination a winning one (Kohler & Mishra 2009). According to Mike Prensky’s work on the ‘digital native’, today’s student likes “to parallel process and multi-task. They prefer their graphics before their text…[and] prefer random access (like hypertext)”, and this image-heavy, hyperlinked platform allows students to do many tasks at once, effectively targeting their preferred learning styles (Prensky 2001).

            I have observed many other technologies in the classroom that have inspired me to integrate them within my own. One technology that particularly appeals to students already inundated with technology is social media-informed learning management systems, such as the apps SeeSaw or Class Dojo. As Prensky (2001) mentions, students “thrive on instant gratification and frequent rewards”. With apps like Class Dojo, students can instantly upload their work in class and photos of their process, which can be ‘liked’ by peers and given points and rewards by the teacher, ensuring they stay on task and engaged. This incorporates an element of experience into the classroom that students are attuned to: “The central idea of the Experience Age is this — I’ll show you my point of view, you give me your attention. [… T]he stories we tell each other now begin and end visually[…] In the Experience Age, the primary input is visual and the dominant feedback is attention.” (Wadhera 2016). Technologies like Class Dojo allow teachers to transform their content into images that circulate in the digital-experiential economy, and gain access to the endorphin-releasing potential of getting recognized and ‘liked’ beyond traditional feedback. <br>
