          <p> In my own practice, I look for ways to incorporate technology beyond its regular use as projection device, minds on video, or interactive quiz. Throughout this course on integrating technology into the classroom, I have learned to critically analyze technology from a pedagogical perspective, in order to see how it is aiding in my ability to deliver course content and allowing students to engage and demonstrate curriculum expectations. 


With this in mind, I am particularly proud of my ability throughout this course to use a hyperlink-based narrative-building platform called Twine to construct a story (add link). As a humanities teacher many of our courses are designed to be incredibly low-tech, and using this platform to teach the English curriculum feels like a step in technology’s direction.

            With Twine, a student learns the elements of coding websites to construct their story, and hosts it onto the web to be viewed by an authentic audience. In this case, technology is not only something that students are gaining implicit knowledge of through their demonstration of the English curriculum, it is also being used to increase their creativity, allowing them to problem solve and think critically, and share something they are proud of to a global audience – all important elements of the 21st century competencies we in Ontario are trying to implement (Ontario Ministry of Education 2016). 
<br><br>
 
Throughout this course, I have been taught about tech integration frameworks such as the SAMR model of Dr. Ruben Puentedura and TPACK of Mishra and Kohler (2006). In terms of the SAMR model, – which illustrates how technologies can have varying levels of meaningful uses in a classroom from simply acting as a substitution for a low-tech alternative up to using technology to redefine and create new tasks in the classroom that could not be done before, – Twine allows for students to make stories with a degree of control and expression that could not be done without the use of its coding language  (Puentedura 2014). Thinking of this use of technology on the TPACK model, which considers the ways three variables within a classroom – content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and technological knowledge – interact with each other to inform best practices in teaching, Twine effectively leverages technology with relevant content in an English classroom and an engaging inquiry-based pedagogical approach to make its TPACK combination a winning one (Kohler & Mishra 2009). According to Mike Prensky’s work on the ‘digital native’, today’s student likes “to parallel process and multi-task. They prefer their graphics before their text…[and] prefer random access (like hypertext)”, and this image-heavy, hyperlinked platform allows students to do many tasks at once, effectively targeting their preferred learning styles (Prensky 2001). 
<br><br>
            I have observed many other technologies in the classroom that have inspired me to integrate them within my own. One technology that particularly appeals to students already inundated with technology is social media-informed learning management systems, such as the apps SeeSaw or Class Dojo. As Prensky (2001) mentions, students “thrive on instant gratification and frequent rewards”. With apps like Class Dojo, students can instantly upload their work in class and photos of their process, which can be ‘liked’ by peers and given points and rewards by the teacher, ensuring they stay on task and engaged. This incorporates an element of experience into the classroom that students are attuned to: “The central idea of the Experience Age is this — I’ll show you my point of view, you give me your attention. [… T]he stories we tell each other now begin and end visually[…] In the Experience Age, the primary input is visual and the dominant feedback is attention.” (Wadhera 2016). Technologies like Class Dojo allow teachers to transform their content into images that circulate in the digital-experiential economy, and gain access to the endorphin-releasing potential of getting recognized and ‘liked’ beyond traditional feedback. <br>

           I have also been inspired by the use of technology for instruction purposes in the classroom. Using video recording software such as iMovie can be used by students and teachers to transmit knowledge to viewers all over the world or just inside the classroom. As such, not only is it a good assessment method, but it is great for initial instruction as well, using the flipped classroom principle. According to Howton (2017), creating screencasts and videos for students to watch at home before class on a topic is more effective than lecturing in the classroom. “This flipped learning setup frees up my students to use class time to practice their skills”, rather than sitting passively and hoping they understand; now, students use class time to ask questions and workshop what they have already learned, which creates more time in class for collaboration and creativity (Howton 2017). <br>

            Additionally, mind-mapping software is becoming increasingly user friendly and experimental in its ability to embed resources and facilitate collaboration. For example, the use of Prezi in the classroom can greatly aid the collaboration of groups as they outline tasks and brainstorm, or peer edit. All users can log into one uploaded presentation and work on the process from their own devices. This is a form of redefining the task of group work, because without this technology, collaborating in groups is limited to a physical space, rearranging and editing a physical object which can only take so much manipulation at one time before it gets overcrowded. With the added element of connectivity, mind mapping and brainstorming becomes a collaborative effort, which is usually done individually without the aid of technology to link various people. As such, when a student participates in a mind-mapping exercise, a teacher can actively measure their skills at collaboration, a key 21st Century Competency. Computer based mind maps can aid in creativity and student engagement because they can embed links, add photos, and other elements that drawing out would be impossible to do, and they can easily upload it to be shared with others. <br>

In the short-term future, I would like my relationship with technology to be informed by even more theories and research. For starters, I feel we should be implementing more technological approaches to assessment in order to be more efficient in how we individualize and administer feedback to parents/guardians and students.  As learning increasingly integrates with technology, algorithms are becoming able to record user data on the correctness of the work they input into it, and learning systems will be able to provide instant and valid feedback and advice to learners and teachers concerning future learning strategies, based on the learners’ individual learning needs and preferences. Explicit testing could thus become obsolete” (Redecker & Johannessen 2013). As a teacher, I can implement as many technological assessments as possible for formative feedback, so students can have efficient results and new lessons tailored just for them, using technology to inform differentiated instruction. I will try to learn more about them from doing additional research, and seeing which are simple yet effective, and which are very complex and powerful to discern which can be easily integrated for starters in the classroom.
<br><br>
Paying attention to accessibility is also a great next step for goals with technology. Assistive technology is becoming more and more accessible on students’ smartphone devices and computers. The great thing about apps as assistive technology is they take away the stigma of having assistive tech in the classroom. No one has to see what the student(s) in question who may need special apps to achieve their learning goals are doing on their phones and iPads, and in fact, many of these apps are turning out to be so engaging that all students are using them or variations. A conscientious teacher may take note of all the assistive technologies that are out there to use in the classrooms to ensure all of their students are meeting their learning goals. And technologies really can help students to focus and overcome physical, emotional, cognitive, and learning disabilities – a study at the University of Toronto has “found that students’ ability to identify pictures increased by 45-60 percent during a six-week period when using touch-screen technology. It also noted significant improvements in the students’ attention spans” (Bartolotti 2012). In the future, I will design my units with thought taken towards the accommodations that can be made on tasks through use of assistive technologies. As mentioned by Sider & Maich (2014), “we should remember that assistive technology can support the learning of all students”. Assistive technology benefits everyone in the end because its applications are so versatile and the issues they help solve are so wide-reaching.
<br><br>
When designing my lessons and units, I will always try to give students transferrable skills so they can maximize the benefits from being in my class. This is partly a reason why I would want to include coding in some of my tasks in the classroom. It’s something I feel many students and their parents would thank me for, since, as Eric Larson (2013) mentions, “the private sector has for years been pressing sixth through twelfth grade schools to prepare kids earlier on for the tech-heavy workforce lying ahead of them. Code.org reports more than 1.4 million computer jobs will be in demand by 2020, yet only 400,000 students will go on to study computer science in college”. Coding helps to unlock the efficiency of machine learning, which gives us access to new knowledge and concepts the human brain couldn’t conceive of or perform with the efficiency and ease of a computer; this alone helps to increase the amount of inquiry that can be done in our classrooms. In terms of the 21st Century Competencies, coding not only improves digital literacy through innovation and creativity, it also builds environments for collaboration amongst peers. The coding process is wrought with challenges and difficulties (I speak from experience having coded this website from scratch), which can only be efficiently solved as a team, regardless of how individualized the task might be. In Janice Mak’s classroom where coding was an integral part of the process, “being put in a situation where they were ‘stuck’ spontaneously led my students to a paired-programming approach that involved communication and collaboration with their peers. Instead of struggling independently on complex tasks, they asked one another for ideas and leads to solve the challenges” (2014). In my own classroom, I would like to implement coding languages such as Python to allow students to data mine texts and compare and contrast what they have found, allowing them to ask deeper questions about the material. Again, we are seeing how technology in the classroom can help to redefine and extend the kinds of questions and kinds of results we are able to perform in a classroom.  
<br><br>

A lot of research has been done recently about the effects of social media use not just on students, but also in terms of how it could enhance their learning in schools. As such, in the near future I believe teachers should start integrating our students’ social media accounts more into our classrooms. Because it is such a taboo subject to discuss social media and how it gets used, a lot of students do not develop good habits when using it. However, research suggests there are beneficial aspects to social media and bringing it into the classroom can not only unlock them, but also allow social media practices and skills to get taught. According to Jim Asher (2015), “[with social media, the class] can have real-time dialogues with experts, museums, publishers, journalists, and more. I remember the excitement when a major library retweeted information about a project one class was working on. Also, in a PBL summer school program, the class promoted student work via Twitter, and students were amazed by all the responses from around the world”. Not only does social media use in the classroom create inquiry and connection, it can also change bad habits and invite students to raise questions about social media and what gets shared: “just as they must sit through algebra and world history, they need to learn how to use these tools safely and responsibly” (Knorr 2014). This line of thinking is very much akin to Selwyn (2009)’s critique of Prensky’s digital native: in reality many young people’s engagement with technology is often far more passive, solitary, sporadic and unspectacular, be it at home or in school”. In other words, students need to be explicitly taught how to use social media and what to do with the barrage of information it feeds to them daily. In our classrooms, students can bring posts they find from social media to assess, unpack, deconstruct and evaluate the messages being proliferated. Social media can also get students involved in social justice initiatives by attuning them to social media influencers and accounts/news websites that cover a range of topics, putting them into conversation while also igniting creativity to problem solve for the greater good. Social media and 21st Century Competencies go hand in hand here.

              In the future, as an ongoing process I would like to learn more about experimental digital-based publishing and all of the technology that would go along with it. I feel as an English teacher, publishing and disseminating students’ stories and opinions can aid in extending their influence and the authenticity of my tasks. Many publishers such as <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/" target="_blank">e-flux journal</a>
e-flux journal and <a href=https://monoskop.org/Monoskop" target="_blank">monoskop</a> can keep me up to date with publishing direction in the future, and some have resources for coding and creating publications. There is a Masters of Design program at the Piet Zwart Institute in Experimental Publishing with an extensive online resource of course content and research (link), which is also helpful to use to keep up to date on this. 
<br> <br>
In addition, I would like to know more about video production, as I feel ‘edutainment’ and shareable videos of knowledge is only going to get more and more popularized as a form of instruction, and flipped classrooms will become more prevalent.  Dis.art (link) is a good example of contemporary critical theory infiltrating the edutainment, TedTalk-ification of knowledge and ideas. If this is the mainstream form of knowledge consumption, we must understand how to infiltrate it and make sure all voices are represented through this major data streamway. 
<br><br>
I would like to get better at coding as well, and stay up to date on the most useful languages. There are plenty of good YouTube channels such as DevTips (link) to help as a resource, or subscribing on twitter to numerous programmers who will continually discuss issues related to coding and new projects that were developed. 
<br><br>
In my classes, I would like to design content and projects that allow students to use the 21st Century Competencies to improve their lives and sense of self. In turn, I want them to understand it is the skills of collaboration, creativity, innovation, critical thinking, problem solving, and being a good global citizen that improved their lives and sense of self. This is something they can take from me and build on throughout their lives. I want them to understand that innovation, entrepreneurship and programming our world cannot be done without understanding genuine problems for communities, which extended from local to global. Too much of tech is a game of privilege and finding ways to maintain the status quo. I want my students to never lose sight of how collaboration and problem solving need to be involved, and they have to think critically and analyze how power and politics are coming into play in their projects and goals. Teaching students to utilize technology in this way and create their own media and apps can help fight the neoliberalization of technology.
<br><br>
In my future classroom, I would want my students to utilize coding languages to create their own web content and their own media to share and disseminate. I want them to have the tools to create counternarratives against the mainstream, and exercise student voice to fight against the proliferating media messages that decided for them and represent to them what kids their age and generation are supposed to be like and what they are supposed to care about. 
<br><br>
I would like to center my use of technologies in place-based learning practices, such as using technologies like Actionbound and HP Reveal to get students moving around their communities to understand their histories, the many voices of their communities, and use the technologies to highlight some of the problems these communities find, of which my students may be able to use their other skills between technology, my curriculum, and the 21st Century Competencies, to create possible solutions.
