          <p> I believe that every teacher and student can benefit from a total integration of technology in our daily practices at school. The ultimate goal of education is to transmit skills, knowledges, and opportunities to students that can positively transform their lives; 
            technology is playing an increasingly integral role in this. Previously impossible assessments, forms of expression, communication, and environments are now within an app’s reach. 
            With technology, we can unlock new knowledge and redefine learning experiences in every discipline, allowing students to extend their knowledge into further reaches. In the globalized information economy of the 21st century, we are obligated to update the skillsets we are imparting on our students to appeal to today’s employers and projects. But most importantly, teaching technological literacy in a world that is mediated by technology that is manufactured by corporations will empower our students to transform their world by creating it themselves. From <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-broadnax-afrofuturism-black-panther_us_5a85f1b9e4b004fc31903b95" target="_blank">afrofuturism</a> to xenofeminism, disenfranchised voices are reclaiming their agency through code and technology, and re-imaging their roles and identities in the future.
          Our classrooms can become spaces of ingenuity and affirmation; where students are learning
          more and doing so with greater relevance and agency.

        But how can we create this in our future classrooms? View my action plan for schools to implement.</div>  </p>
